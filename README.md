# Citi Bike NYC

In this repository we have created a Tableau story based on Citi Bike bicycle rental data in New York City. The aim is to persuade investors to invest in a pilot location in Des Moines Iowa. The story can be seen at this link: https://public.tableau.com/profile/thomas.k.stover#!/vizhome/CitiBikeChallenge_16177490156440/CitiBikeAnalysis?publish=yes.

## Results



The bicycles are typically rented for a short period of time (a peak of 5 minutes) around the rush hour, commuting hours based around a typical work schedule. This suggests that users are renting the bicycles as a means of transportation into work from home. This trend can be seen in not only the ‘Peak hours for August 2019’ bar graph but also in the ‘Trips by weekday per hour’ heatmap. 

Looking at the top starting/ending location map you will see that the busiest starting locations also tend to be the busiest ending locations. This further supports the theory that users are renting the bicycles as a means of transportation into work. They start at the nearest location to home in the morning then end at the nearest to work, then start from work and end back at home.  

The users are a majority male who are subscribed to the rental service. The ‘Checkout times for users based on gender’ graph shows the large difference in male rentals, based on time. As time grows larger, the three gender categories converge. 

New York is an incredibly unique city that is densely populated and has a great public transit system. Car ownership is rare for those living in the city and most walk to their respective public transit stations. These conditions make the city ideal for a subscription-based bicycle rental service.
